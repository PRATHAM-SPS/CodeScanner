# CodeScanner 📝🔍💻

**Project Contributions**:

CodeScanner is a mobile application designed to be a powerful tool for developers and programming enthusiasts who prefer writing code on paper. With this app, users can easily digitize their handwritten code using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology and compile it directly within the app, saving valuable time and effort.

Key Features:

- **Multi-Language Support**: The app supports six different programming languages, including Java, Python, C++, C, PHP, and Ruby. Users can choose their preferred language, and the app will automatically detect the code syntax and compile it accordingly.

- **Effortless Scanning**: The scanning process is user-friendly and efficient. Users can simply take a photo of their handwritten code using their phone's camera or upload an image from their device's photo gallery. The app utilizes OCR technology to analyze the image and display the code on the screen.

- **Built-In Testing Environment**: After the code is compiled, users can test it directly within the app using a built-in testing environment. This feature allows users to ensure that their code functions correctly before exporting it to their preferred development environment.

- **Proofreading**: The app provides users with the opportunity to preview and proofread the converted code before sending it to the compiler for execution. This helps maintain code accuracy and quality.

**Implementation Process**:

The implementation process of CodeScanner involves several steps:

1. **Code Scanning**: The app utilizes the device's camera to scan handwritten code and converts it into editable text using an OCR model.

2. **Proofreading**: The converted text is presented to the user for proofreading and correction if necessary.

3. **Compilation**: Once the user is satisfied with the scanned code, it is sent to the compiler for execution.

4. **Multi-Language Support**: CodeScanner supports a variety of programming languages, including Python3, Java, C, C++, PHP, and Ruby. 🌐
