# CodeScanner

There are times when people are unable to access a computer to test out their handwritten programming codes, during commute or in between their classes. There are students who are not sure whether the code they have written in class on a paper is error free or not. 

So this code scanner is going to aid them in compiling their handwritten programming code and displaying the output by scanning their codes from their paper and executing it within the app while stating errors and outputs.

This code scanner app is a Java based project and it will be compiled and run in Android Studio Code. The OCR will be run with the help of Google Vision Library. The second part of the project will be a compiler which will compile and give the output of the scanned handwritten code.
